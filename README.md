# Bubbles of Rain

_College project for learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript_

## Website: [VSebastian8.github.io](https://vsebastian8.github.io)

The project consists of 3 simple static web pages that link to eachother. The first page shows some `rain animation`, along with some facts about this weather phenomenon. Next is a satisfying `bubble popping minigame` and last is an user `review` page with a pattern changing background.
